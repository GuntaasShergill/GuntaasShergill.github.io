Hi, I'm Guntaas. I work as a research technician II in the [Polineni Lab](https://pediatricallergypulmonary.wustl.edu/items/polineni-lab/) @ WashU, where I perform computational research pertinent to Cystic Fibrosis (CF). The following are a list of projects I have led or am leading within my role in the Polineni Lab.

Past Projects
- identified optimal insertion sites for a superexon gene editing cure in CF
- created a lung disease severity tool for people with CF

Current Projects
- designing deep learning architecture to infer the multi-omic molecular signaling that dictates inflammation in people with CF
- CFTR variant discovery and pathogenicity testing using large public genomic databases [Funded by a Cystic Fibrosis Student Traineeship Grant]
- Designing candidate guide RNAs for a CF gene editing cure and assessing off-target effects [Funded by a Cystic Fibrosis Student Traineeship Grant]

I am also a master's student in the [WashU I2DB](https://i2db.wustl.edu) Biomedical Informatics program. I perform my master's research with the [Li Lab](https://fuhailiailab.github.io), contributing to the development of novel deep learning architecture for inferrence of molecular signaling across disease and cell-states.

In my prospective doctoral studies, I am interested in pursuing the development of deep learning models and methodologies to advance biology and medicine.

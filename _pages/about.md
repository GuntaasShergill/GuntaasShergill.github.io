Hi, I'm Guntaas. I work as a research technician II in the [Polineni Lab](https://pediatricallergypulmonary.wustl.edu/items/polineni-lab/) @ WashU, where I perform computational research pertinent to Cystic Fibrosis (CF). I am concurrently a master's student in the Biomedical Informatics program in [I2DB @ WashU](https://i2db.wustl.edu) . As a part of my master's, I perform research with the [Li Lab](https://fuhailiailab.github.io) for development of novel deep learning architecture for inferrence of molecular signaling across disease and cell-states.

Past Projects (as a Lead)
- identified optimal insertion sites for a superexon gene editing cure in CF
- created a lung disease severity tool for people with CF

Current Projects (as a Lead)
- designing deep learning architecture to infer the multi-omic molecular signaling that dictates inflammation in people with CF
- CFTR variant discovery and pathogenicity testing using large public genomic databases [Funded by a Cystic Fibrosis Student Traineeship Grant]
- Designing candidate guide RNAs for a CF gene editing cure and assessing off-target effects [Funded by a Cystic Fibrosis Student Traineeship Grant]

Going forward, during my doctoral studies, I am interested in pursuing the development of deep learning architectures to advance biology and medicine.
